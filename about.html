        <h2>Hobbies/Passions</h2>
        <div class="description-container">
            <div class="descrip"><p>I've always enjoyed video games and animations since I was a kid. However I've always been on lower-quality devices that are very sub-par so I've never been able to really get into things like Blender and Unreal. However! There is a program called Pixelorama, which introduced me to the wonderful world of Pixel Art, that is what most of my animations are done in.</p></div>

        <h2>Animating</h2>
        <div class="description-container">
            <div class="descrip"><p>I have always enjoyed watching animations and breaking down the frames, studying just exactly how each and every single little frame adds to the bigger picture. There's lots that goes into it. Stretching, Squishing, Animation Loops, Color Theories, etc. I use Pixelorama and have used other sources as well to make animations through Pixel Art.</p></div>

        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <div class="description-container">
            <div class="descrip"><p>Recently I have gained a slowly growing passion for drawing. Wouldn't say I'm good at it at all, however I always enjoy it. My dream job has been becoming an Animator which would involve Drawing, however recently I've been considering keeping it more of a hobby rather then an career.</p></div>

            <div class="descrip"><p>Currently W.I.P (Work In Progress), I plan to add to the game of my Portfolio a <b>Boss Battle</b>.

The Boss will have three different attacks and the player will have to whittle the Boss HP Bar down while dodging the Boss's three different attacks!</p></div>
